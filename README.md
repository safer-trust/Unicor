**Unicor is a generic correlation and alerting engine, matching MISP events against JSON input from a variety of sources.**

Sources include `dnstap` with [DNS-collector](https://github.com/dmachard/DNS-collector) or any JSON source in the [Unicor schema](#unicor-json-schema) and include Zeek, Netflow alerts and more.

Unicor does retro-searches too, it will go back to previously ingested data and attempt to match it again against more recently added MISP events.

Unicor is the successor of [pDNSSOC](https://github.com/safer-trust/pdnssoc-cli), and is proudly supported by [SAFER](https://safer-trust.org) members.

## Installation summary

A complete Unicor installation only requires:
  1. Access to a MISP instance (URL + API key are required)
  2. A source of data, for example:
  - `dnstap` files (typically rsync'ed via SSH) and a local [DNS-collector](https://github.com/dmachard/DNS-collector)
  - Any source (Zeek, etc.) producing files in the [Unicor JSON schema](#unicor-json-schema)
  4. A destination for alerts: Webhooks like Slack are highly recommended, or email (deprecated)

The installation guide will focus first on deploying and configuring Unicor, then provide configuration examples for different input sources.

## Installation guide

### Installing Unicor
    
The recommended installation path is to use a binary form of unicor, produced by PyInstaller.
(It may be necessary to install dependencies and specifically reference PyMISP)
```
git clone https://github.com/safer-trust/unicor.git
cd unicor/src/
pyinstaller  --add-binary="/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/pymisp:pymisp" -F  unicor.py
```
Then the binary will be readily available:
```
 ./dist/unicor 
Usage: unicor [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  -c, --config FILE  Read option defaults from the specified yaml file
                     [default: /etc/unicor/config.yml]
  --help             Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  alert       Raise alerts for spotted incidents
  correlate   Correlate input files and output matches
  fetch-iocs  Fetch IOCs from intelligence sources
```

A ELF 64-bit dynamically linked version is also directly available in the [dist directory](https://github.com/safer-trust/unicor/tree/main/src/dist) of the repository.
